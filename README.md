### Hi there, My name is Justin and welcome to my GitHub Profile. 👋


---------------------------------------------------------
- Bio:  Just a man trying to follow a dream of writing software and/or web applications. 
        After being in management for over 10 years I decided it was my turn to follow my dreams and work on doing something that I really enjoyed. After helping so many people with their career goals I left it all behind, went back to school, and have been working hard ever sence. Code is more then computer language to me, it is my art form.
---------------------------------------------------------

- 🔭 I’m currently working on finishing my BAS in Computing and Information Sciences at the University of North Florida
- 🌱 I’m currently learning pretty much everything however, I am working with ASP.NET MVC design and deployment for school.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I create animated wallpapers using "Wallpaper Engine".  They are more fun then anything else, plus it gives me a chance to do something different.
- 🥅 2020 Goals: I spend most of my time coding on the back end for school. I really want to learn Visual Novels using python and renpy. Maybe make a Mod for DDLC, or take up Unity for a change. <--I enjoy learning can you tell? LoL!
