### Hi there, My name is Justin and welcome to my GitHub Profile. ðŸ‘‹


---------------------------------------------------------
- Bio:  Just a man trying to follow a dream of writing software and/or web applications. 
        After being in management for over 10 years I decided it was my turn to follow my dreams and work on doing something that I really enjoyed. After helping so many people with their career goals I left it all behind, went back to school, and have been working hard ever sense. Code is more then computer language to me, it is my art form.
---------------------------------------------------------

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing my BAS in Computing and Information Sciences at the University of North Florida
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning pretty much everything I can get my hands on however, I am working with ASP.NET MVC design and deployment for school and a local non-profit in Northeast Florida.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I create animated wallpapers using "Wallpaper Engine", and have started building a modification game to Doki Doki Literature Club using RenPy and Python. These little projects are more fun then anything else. 
- ðŸ¥… 2021 Goals: I am finishing up my BAS this spring so I am taking a long look at applying to the UNF School of Computing Graduate program for my Master's.

*Language Notes: Keep in mind this is a metric of what I am using on Github at any given time. This should be used as a reference only... ("A good developer can code in a specific language, but a great developer can write the same code in 3 languages." A great professor told me that and I have been doing what I can to instill it in my studies. )*
