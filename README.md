### Hi there, My name is Justin and welcome to my GitHub Profile. ðŸ‘‹



---------------------------------------------------------
- Bio:  Just a man trying to follow a dream of writing software and/or web applications. 
        After being in management for over 10 years I decided it was my turn to follow my dreams and work on doing something that I really enjoyed. After helping so many people with their career goals I left it all behind, went back to school, and have been working hard ever sence. Code is more then computer language to me, it is my art form.
---------------------------------------------------------

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing my BAS in Computing and Information Sciences at the University of North Florida
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ASP.NET MVC design and deployment.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I create wallpapers using "Steam Wallpaper Engine". Feel free to check them out on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC66vCWqoBQUACB07zVaMcsA) or my [steamwork shop](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198250654632/myworkshopfiles/?appid=431960). They are more fun then anything else, plus it gives me a chance to do something different.

*Language Notes: Keep in mind this is a metric of what I am using on Github at any given time. This should be used as a reference only... However as of right now I am really enjoying C#... Can you tell? loL*
